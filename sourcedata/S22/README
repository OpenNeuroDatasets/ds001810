The data for the first ("pre") block for S22_2I were accidentally recorded together with a resting state block, which was used to measure spontaneous eye blink rate (for another project). The "S22_2I_pre_orig.zip" file contains the original, erroneously combined recording. To correct the error, the "S22_2I_pre.bdf" file was manually split from this file, and only contains the task data from the "pre" block.
